**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**To Reproduce**
> The *best* way is to provide an [SSCCE (Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example)](http://sscce.org/). One type of SSCCE could be a small test which reproduces the issue and can be run without dependencies. The [XQSuite - Annotation-based Test Framework for XQuery](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xqsuite.xml) makes it very easy for you to create tests. These tests can be executed from the [eXide editor](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/eXide/index.html) `XQuery` > `Run as Test`.

```xquery
xquery version "3.1";

module namespace t="http://exist-db.org/xquery/test";

declare namespace test="http://exist-db.org/xquery/xqsuite";

(: Replace root with your data :)
declare variable $t:XML := document {
    <root/>
};

(: Replace index config if needed :)
declare variable $t:xconf := document {
    <collection xmlns="http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0">
        <index xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
            <fulltext default="none" attributes="false"/>
        </index>
    </collection>
};

(: Collections and Indexes can be configured here :)
declare
    %test:setUp
function t:setup() {
    let $testCol := xmldb:create-collection("/db", "test")
    let $indexCol := xmldb:create-collection("/db/system/config/db", "test")
    return
        (
            xmldb:store("/db/test", "test.xml", $t:XML),
            xmldb:store("/db/system/config/db/test", "collection.xconf", $t:xconf),
            xmldb:reindex("/db/test")
        )
};

declare
    %test:tearDown
function t:tearDown() {
    xmldb:remove("/db/test"),
    xmldb:remove("/db/system/config/db/test")
};

(: Adjust to your reported issue :)
declare
    %test:assertEquals(1)
function t:test-1() {
    let $test-data := collection('/db/test')
    for $result in $test-data//root
    return
       count($result)
};
```
