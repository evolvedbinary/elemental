## XML Serialization options for the WevDAV
## The file is read from the classpath
## Be careful changing the default values !
#indent=yes
#expand-xincludes=no
#process-xsl-pi=no
#encoding=UTF-8
omit-xml-declaration=yes
omit-original-xml-declaration=no
output-doctype=yes

## Whilst for non-XML documents the exact size of the documents can
## be determined by checking the blob store metadata, this is not possible
## for XML documents.
##
## For XML documents by default the 'approximate' size is available
## which can be sufficient (pagesize * number of pages). Exact size
## is dependent on factors like the serialization parameters.
##
## The approximate size is a good indication of the size of document
## but some WebDAV clients, in particular the macOS Finder version, can
## not deal with this estimate, resulting in incomplete or overcomplete
## documents.
##
## To address these various possibilities, two system variables can be set
## to change the way the size is calculated.
##
## Supported values are NULL, EXACT, APPROXIMATE
##
## PROPFIND:
## Unfortunately both NULL and APPROXIMATE do not work for
## macOS Finder. The default behaviour for the Finder 'user-agent' is
## exact, for the others it is approximate.
##
## GET:
## The NULL value seems to be working well for macOS too.
##
## The system properties are:
## -Dorg.exist.webdav.PROPFIND_METHOD_XML_SIZE=..  (used for listing documents in collection)
## -Dorg.exist.webdav.GET_METHOD_XML_SIZE=...      (used during download of one document)
##
## Supported values are:
## NULL         - document sizes are NOT reported                              [Alternative]
## EXACT        - document sizes are reported using document pre-serialization [Slow]
## APPROXIMATE  - document sizes are reported as (pagesize * number of pages)  [Default]
##
## Depending on the WebDAV client needs, one or both properties can be set.
#
# org.exist.webdav.PROPFIND_METHOD_XML_SIZE=APPROXIMATE
# org.exist.webdav.GET_METHOD_XML_SIZE=APPROXIMATE
